# Week-5-Coding-Quiz
### Description
In this project, I created a Coding Quiz app using DOM manipulation in JavaScript! This coding quiz was extremely challenging, as at first I was lost as to where to even begin. In completing this Coding Quiz, I've gotten a lot more practice with writing functions and have learned different ways in making web pages even MORE interactive with JavaScript. Hope you enjoy!
